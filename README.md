# PVSio-web Examples
This repository provides a collection of interactive simulations developed with PVSio-web. The visual front-end of each simulation builds on Web technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript). Underneath, the the prototype is driven by an executable formal model developed in PVS.

The examples were develped within [CHI+MED](https://www.chi-med.ac.uk/), as part of a research effort on improving the safety of human-machine interfaces in medical devices.
